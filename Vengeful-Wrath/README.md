Attached note:

> Okay! Hi there! As it goes with any STL file made by anyone else, the fit and usability of these parts are subject to… well… sketchiness… In other words, they may not work.
>
> I try to personally ensure that what I actively put energy into to share (let alone design) works well enough to make your time worth it, but you know how it goes.
>
> This is a file I whipped up fast for testing out how much a Kailh keycap intrudes into areas I may need to work in, such as a case and where screws mount, however, I’ve found them comfortable and they seem to have a decent look that drags in a lot of questions, hence why I posted them.
>
> I printed mine with a resin printer at ludicrously high resolution to mitigate resolution lines. It may be possible to do these with an FDM printer, however, I would not do that outside of the intentions of prototyping, fun, or whatnot. They simply will not last. But please! I invite you to prove me wrong. I actually do like it when people do so!

> Have fun, be creative, and always post your work so others can enjoy it. Inspiration is fuel for every step moving forward! `^,...^`
