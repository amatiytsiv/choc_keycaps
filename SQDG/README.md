Files with a -1x suffix, are 'actual size'; everything else is 10x size for fidelity. Scale 'em down in your slicer.

Most folks will want the simple SQDG-choc-r3 and SQDG-choc-r24 caps. If you want the others, you already know why.

R3 = home how. R24 = row above and below home row.

SQDG-b34rpaw files are sized for ronzeco's b34rpaw board, w/ its 21mm X pitch and chopped choc-min Y pitch. If you aren't building for that board, these files are ignorable.
