## A note regarding rights aimed at creators

I see people have found this repo which is great! However, if you find _your_
stuff here and you don't like that, let me know and I'll remove the files and
just link instead.

I don't want anyone to feel that their work is being taken advantage of. I
wouldn't add any STL's that aren't already publically available somewhere
(like, STL's shared on some Discord server, that's not public and there's no
good way to link to the source). I've tried to make licenses clear and to link
to the sources but the STL files are not mine, they're yours, and I'll remove
them right away if you want me to.
