# Kailh LP Choc Keycap for Corne ("FunkMonk") by Stephan Park

Source: <https://grabcad.com/library/kailh-lp-choc-keycap-for-corne-1>.

> These keycaps were inspired by a picture in a forum. 1u, 1u home and 1.5u are all that is needed to populate the Corne. Only keycap model and parametric (Fusion 360) files are provided. Please modify User Parameters within reason, Fusion does not have conditional equations so the model can easily break but have fun!

> Note: The keys' skirts are a little longer than normal so the plate needs to be countersunk. Please check your application for travel clearance.
